EASIFEM is an Expandable And Scalable Infrastructure for Finite Element Methods. It is a Modern Fortran framework developed for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by using finite element methods and other grid based methods. 
We believe that EASIFEM will "ease" the creation of high-performance scientific softwares.
